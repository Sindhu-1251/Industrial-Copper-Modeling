# Industrial Copper Modeling

## Introduction

Elevate your data analysis and machine learning capabilities with our "Industrial Copper Modeling" project. This project tackles the complexities of sales and pricing data in the copper industry through advanced machine learning techniques. You will create regression models for precise pricing predictions and classification models for better customer targeting. Additionally, you'll acquire skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and developing web applications with Streamlit, preparing you to address real-world challenges in manufacturing effectively.

## Technologies Used

- Python scripting
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Streamlit

## Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Assess the dataset for skewness and outliers.
   - Visualize data distributions and relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Generate new features to improve model performance.
   - Select relevant features for modeling.

4. **Model Development**:
   - **Regression Model**:
     - Develop a Decision Tree Regressor to predict 'Selling_Price'.

   - **Classification Model**:
     - Develop a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the status (WON/LOST).

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.
   - Fine-tune the models for better performance.

6. **Web Application Development**:
   - Build a Streamlit app for user interaction.
   - Allow users to input data and receive predictions for 'Selling_Price' and status (WON/LOST).
